# Data-Cleansing


## Background
As a new learner in Python, especially in Data Science, I find it quite hard to learn in self paced method.

This Repository is based on my intense bootcamp class i joined.

The goals in this exercise to do preprocessing data before do the basic of exploratory data analysis.

## Datasets Used

The datasets used for this exercise can be access from kaggle ((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
This data is about :
 * Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
 * Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
 * Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
 * Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
 
 ##Goals on this repository
 
 Basically, only 3 goals set on this Data Cleansing repository which are :
 * lowecase-ing the word on the header
 * removing some words and character ("automatic" & space)
 * preprocessing data
 
 ## Conclusion

Maybe it feel hard for starting to learn something new, especially if you want to mastering it. But, keep walking the walk, one step at a time.
